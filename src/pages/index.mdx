## Getting Started 

### Dependencies

Astro Just Docs is built for Astro, a static site generator. Just the docs requires no additional setup beyond what's normally expected when setting up an Astro website locally. For more details into how Astro works, check out their [getting started guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/). 

### Running Locally

Running Astro Just Docs isnt any different then any other Astro based site, and can be up and running in just a few commands:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:underlost/astro-just-docs.git
cd astro-just-docs
yarn install
yarn dev
```

### Production

Astro Just Docs has been tested to run in just about any enviroment a normal an Astro-based website can run, such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

If youre looking to host the site on more traditional host, run 

```shell
yarn build
```

to create a public folder that you can then upload anywhere!

### Configuring 

Astro Just Docs has a number of helpful settings. Refer to the [configuration](/configuration/) section for all options available.
