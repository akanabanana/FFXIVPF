Astro Just Docs is powered by PageFind.  to add client side search powered by a JSON index that Gatsby generates on *build*. Search results are shown in an auto complete dropdown. There is no search page. By default, all search results are indexed using the following data points:

- title
- MetaTitle
- MetaDescription

## Enabling search

Search is enabled by default.

## Generating search results

Search results are generated automatically on site build (`yarn build`).

## Hiding pages from search

Currently all MDX files will be indexed and fully searchable. Allowing pages to be flagged as not indexed is a planned feature for the future.
